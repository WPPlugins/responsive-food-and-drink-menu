== Description ==
This plugin lets you easily create a responsive food and drink menu either as a page or by using shortcode to insert a menu into your posts or pages.  To display the menu in pages or posts, use this shortcode - [display_menu p=YOUR_MENU_ID_HERE] - where YOUR_MENU_ID_HERE is the ID of the menu post you created.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the un-zipped directory to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Now you are ready to create your first menu by going to "Menu Pages" -> "Add New"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: How do I use the menu on other parts of my website?
A: You accomplish this with shortcodes. Just take this text: 

[display_menu p=YOUR_MENU_ID_HERE] 

and replace YOUR_MENU_ID_HERE with the post ID of the menu you want to display. Then paste the code in your page or post where you want the menu to appear.

Q: My menu looks off with my theme. Why is this? What can I do?
A: If you are using the shortcode method of displaying your menu, the menu should use the theme's style to display the menu's content. This could be an issue with the theme itself. If you are using the page method to display your menu, the plugin uses the $content_width variable to apply a max width to menu. If you are having issues, reach out to a developer or myself for support.
